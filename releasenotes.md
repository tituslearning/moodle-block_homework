### Titus Learning modifications to Homework block 

v1.1.19 December 2017
Homework in block is hidden from students if the assignment or grade in gradebook is hidden.
Added option to use a dropdown for the subject field which will make data more consistent. The values for the subject field are added through the settings page.
Added a CSS fix to ensure that the Atto editor works with the editing area for  introduction field.
Added code in events to sweep assignments into a hidden topic at the bottom of the course after a set amount of time and to delete fully after a set amount of time
The grading scale now defaults to none, previously it defaulted to Points (Out of 100)
